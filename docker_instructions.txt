To get the CI with gitlab I first had to get the docker image on to Heroku.  The steps I followed were roughly those outlined below (copied from terminal history sometime after actually doing it).


docker-compose build

(Check the image is there)
docker images

heroku container:login

heroku create

(The second command here might be the best to use, it's possible the first one didn't work but I'm not sure if it is important)
heroku container:release riverservice_web:latest --app riverservice
heroku container:release registry.heroku.com/riverservice/riverservice_web --app riverservice 

heroku container:push --app riverservice --context-path . web

heroku container:release --app riverservice web

Following the instructions here, https://davekz.com/docker-on-lightsail/ , we choose an Ubuntu instance and use the script saved in this directory, called lightsail_launch_script.txt.
